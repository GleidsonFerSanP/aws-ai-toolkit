# Changelog

All notable changes to the "AWS AI Toolkit" extension will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-01-16

### 🔐 Intelligent Credentials Discovery

**Added:**
* **Smart Credentials Search**: Extension now automatically discovers AWS credentials using multiple methods:
  - MCP Profile storage (extension-managed profiles)
  - Environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
  - AWS shared credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`)
  - AWS SSO configurations
  - Process credentials
  - AWS SDK default provider chain (includes EC2/ECS metadata)
* **Friendly Error Messages**: Instead of errors, AI receives helpful guidance when credentials aren't found
* **Auto-detection**: Works seamlessly with existing AWS CLI configurations

**Improved:**
* Credentials are tried in intelligent priority order

* Enhanced user experience for credential configuration
